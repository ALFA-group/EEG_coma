This directory contains old code that is uncleaned, unupdated, almost certainly unnecessary in the future.

data\_clean contains the notebooks and scripts I used to do data cleaning. Hopefully no one should have ever have to use these or deal with data cleaning again.   

scp\_utils contains some functions I used to scp files from the openstack instances to my local machine.

file\_list\_utils contains some utility functions I used to create the todo\_files\_list.txt files.
